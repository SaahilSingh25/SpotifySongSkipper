SpotifySongSkipper
This project was built to skip a song on any active device. There is a method for retrieving audio analysis features at the bottom as well.
The project utilizes a combination of JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, Handlebars, and Bootstrap.
You can find the backend JavaScript in the app.js. The frontend HTML, HBS, and AJAX can be found under the views folder.
